                    <h3>Causes</h3>
                    <p>Lumpy skin disease is a viral disease that affects cattle. It is transmitted by blood-feeding insects, such as certain species of flies and mosquitoes, or ticks.

                        It causes fever, nodules on the skin and can also lead to death, especially in animals that that have not previously been exposed to the virus. Control options include vaccinations and culling of infected animals.
                        
                        Lumpy skin disease can lead to significant economic losses.
                        
                        The disease is present in many African countries. In 2012, it spread from the Middle East to south-east Europe, affecting EU Member States (Greece and Bulgaria) and several other countries in the Balkans.</p>

                    <p>Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a serious disease of cattle, water buffalo and banteng. It is spread by biting flies and mosquitoes, midges and possibly ticks. It has never been detected in Australia but is an emerging threat as it continues to spread throughout Asia.<br>
                        There is NO TREATMENT for lumpy-skin disease. Nonspecific treatment (antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and vitamin injections) is usually directed at treating the secondary bacterial infections, inflammation and fever, and improving the appetite of the animal. hoW can you prevent Lumpy-sKin disease in your herd?</p>

                        Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is caused by infection of cattle or
                        water buffalo with the poxvirus Lumpy skin disease virus
                        (LSDV). The virus is one of three closely related species
                        within the genus capripoxvirus, the other two species being
                        Sheeppox virus and Goatpox virus .
                        LSD was first described in Zambia in 1929. Over the next 85
                        years it steadily spread throughout the majority of Africa and
                        into the Middle East. In 2015 the virus entered mainland
                        Europe in Greece, and the Caucasus and Russia. In 2016 the
                        virus spread further east into the Balkans, north towards
                        Moscow, and west into Kazakhstan. It is currently
                        considered a rapidly emerging disease of high consequence.
                        It is notifiable with outbreaks causing significant damage to
                        productivity and trade.

                        There is still a good deal of information lacking about the
                        transmission of LSD. Experimental work has shown that
                        direct transmission from an infected to a naïve animal is very
                        inefficient. Evidence to date supports transmission of the
                        virus via arthropods such as insects or ticks (these are termed
                        virus "vectors"). For example outbreaks of LSD occur during
                        warm, wet weather while the disease usually diminishes in
                        the cooler winter months. In addition, LSD epidemics are
                        often characterised by new outbreaks occurring at distances
                        over 50km from the nearest known disease focus. These
                        characteristics strongly suggest insect-borne transmission,
                        such as mosquitoes and ticks. However, it is unclear which
                        vector species are involved in transmission of LSD, and if it
                        is a simple mechanical transmission of the virus or a more
                        complicated biological transmission involving replication or
                        development of the virus in the vector.
                        Movement of infected cattle can also be a significant factor
                        in the spread of LSD over large distances.</p>

                            The presence of the typical skin nodules is strongly
                            suggestive of LSD (see below).
                            nasal discharge, fever, and sudden decrease in milk
                            production. Morbidity and mortality in the recent
                            Eurasian epidemic has been approximately 10% and 1%
                            respectively. The severity of disease in the 10% of
                            affected cattle in the herd can vary from mild to fatal.
                            Some cattle develop very small numbers of nodules
                            which can be difficult to spot. Others develop
                            innumerable nodules up to 3cm in diameter. The factors
                            determining which cattle develop mild and which
                            develop severe disease are unknown.
                            Disease can be confirmed with a laboratory diagnosis,
                            with tests available to detect the DNA of the virus or
                            antibodies.
                            LSD can be confused with many diseases, including:
                            Pseudo lumpy skin disease (caused by Bovine
                            Herpesvirus 2), Bovine papular stomatitis
                            (Parapoxvirus), Pseudocowpox (Parapoxvirus), Cowpox,

                                    Control and prevention of lumpy skin disease relies on
                                    four tactics - movement control (quarantine), vaccination,
                                    slaughter campaigns and management strategies. Specific
                                    national control plans vary between countries and so
                                    advice should be sought from the relevant authorities and
                                    veterinarians.
                                    Vaccination is the most effective means of control, and
                                    live homologous vaccines containing a Neethling-like
                                    strain of LSDV are recommended.
                                    Treatment
                                    There is no treatment for the virus, so prevention by
                                    vaccination is the most effective means of control.
                                    Secondary infections in the skin may be treated with
                                    Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatories (NSAIDs) and also
                                    antibiotics (topical +/- injectable) when appropriate.

                                    Summary
                                    Lumpy skin disease virus causes a severe disease in
                                    cattle characterised by nodules in the skin. Transmission
                                    of LSD occurs via insect vectors and vaccination is the
                                    most effective means of control. During the past five
                                    years lumpy skin disease has spread through the Middle
                                    East into southeast Europe, the Caucasus, southwest
                                    Russia and western Asia. The disease causes substantial
                                    losses in affected herds with significant economic
                                    consequences. It also blocks access of affected countries
                                    to lucrative export markets, compounding the financial
                                    impact of a LSD outbreak. The main lesson to be learnt
                                    from the current European LSD epidemic is to be vigilant
                                    of emerging diseases.
